## 📖 Overview

In the age of video content, accessing the information inside a video file can be difficult. This project bridges the gap between video media and text analysis. 

By leveraging **n8n** for orchestration and **OpenAI Whisper** for intelligence, this tool automatically converts YouTube URLs into distinct, searchable, and editable text formats. It is perfect for content creators, researchers, and developers looking to archive or analyze video content programmatically.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🔗 Seamless Extraction:** Accepts YouTube URLs and automatically handles audio extraction.
* **🧠 High-Fidelity Transcription:** Uses the `whisper-1` model to achieve near-human accuracy in speech-to-text conversion.
* **⚡ Event-Driven:** Can be triggered manually, via webhook, or through a form interface.
* **📂 Automated Formatting:** Cleans up the raw JSON response into readable text.
* **🌍 Multi-Language Capable:** Automatically detects and transcribes various input languages.

## ⚙️ How It Works

![YouTube Transcription Workflow](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1s2ouxxSzen-hOErW3zcOEjcduXWzO5Zu)

1.  **Input:** The workflow receives a YouTube video URL.
2.  **Download & Extract:** The system downloads the video and extracts the audio track using command-line tools.
3.  **Process:** The audio is optimized to meet API file size limits.
4.  **Transcribe:** The audio file is sent to the OpenAI Whisper API.
5.  **Output:** The resulting transcript is returned to the user or saved to a database/document.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* An instance of **n8n** (Self-hosted or Cloud).
* **OpenAI API Key** (with access to the Whisper model).
* **Python/FFmpeg** installed on the environment running n8n (for the audio extraction step).

### Installation

1.  **Clone/Download** the workflow JSON file from this repository.
2.  Open your n8n dashboard.
3.  Click **"Import from File"** and select the JSON file.
4.  **Configure Credentials:**
    * Open the OpenAI node and paste your API Key.
5.  **Activate** the workflow.
